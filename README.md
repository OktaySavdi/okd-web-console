# OKD Web Console
Change NODE-IP in the ingress definition to your worker node IP. After that, deploying okd.yaml file will bring OKD Web Console(like openshift) to your cluster.

As an example you can check console on [Katacoda Kubernetes Playground](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground)
- Deploy YAML to Kubernetes Cluster and wait for successful deployment.
- Console will be available from [http://console-okd.NODE-IP.nip.io](http://console-okd.NODE-IP.nip.io).

- You can view Operators also after you deploy OLM(OPERATOR LIFECYLE MANAGER) into the cluster from this link: [OLM Github Releases](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/)
